# 🐛 Bug Fixes Summary - October 27, 2025

## ✅ All Fixes Completed

### **1. Ticker Full-Width Scroll** 🎬
**Issue:** Ticker cut off halfway through instead of completing full scroll  
**Fix:** Changed animation from `-50%` to `-100%` in `styles.css`  
**Result:** Ticker now scrolls completely across the screen before looping

### **2. Logo Background Color Control** 🎨
**Issue:** No way to change the color of the box behind L3 logos  
**Fix:**  
- Added "Logo Box Background Color" picker in Styling tab  
- Added `globalLogoBg` to control.js (default: `#ffffff`)  
- Updated `getL3LogoConfig()` to include `logoBg`  
- Updated `graphics.js` to apply background color to all logo containers (single + dual)

**Result:** Can now customize logo box color to match branding

### **3. Quick Color Presets** ⚡
**Issue:** Tedious to change all colors manually  
**Fix:**  
- Added 5 preset buttons in Styling tab:
  - 🔴 RED (#dc3545)
  - 🟢 GREEN (#28a745)
  - 🔵 ROYAL BLUE (#0056b3)
  - 🟠 ORANGE (#fd7e14)
  - 🟣 PURPLE (#6f42c1)
- One-click applies to ALL graphics (L3s, bugs, ticker, timer)
- Updates color pickers to show selected preset

**Result:** Instant house color changes for different shows/segments

### **4. "Open Tab" Button Fix** 🔗
**Issue:** "Open Tab" button opened `control.html` instead of `output.html`  
**Fix:** Updated `btnQuickOpenTab` handler to replace `control.html` with `output.html` before opening  
**Result:** Clicking "Open Tab" now correctly opens the graphics output page
