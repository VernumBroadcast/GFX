Check:
- ✅ `firebase-config.js` should be GONE from the repo

- ✅ `firebase-config.TEMPLATE.js` should be present

### 2. GitHub Alert Should Clear
- The security alert should disappear within a few hours
- GitHub detects that the sensitive file has been removed

### 3. Still Need to Revoke the Old Key!
Even though it's removed from GitHub, you should still:
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Revoke/delete the exposed API key
3. Create a new restricted key
4. Update your local `firebase-config.js`

See `SECURITY_ALERT.md` for detailed instructions.
