### 3. **Triple L3 System - COMPLETE!**

#### **Multi L3s Tab** (renamed from "Dual L3s")
- ‚úÖ Mode selector: **Dual (2 L3s)** or **Triple (3 L3s)**
- ‚úÖ Dual mode: Left + Right (with logos)
- ‚úÖ Triple mode: Left + **Center** + Right (center has NO logo for cleaner look)
- ‚úÖ All positions use your 5 pre-configured L3 slots
- ‚úÖ Dynamic UI: Center slot selector only shows in Triple mode

#### **Technical Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ **output.html** - Added center L3 HTML element
- ‚úÖ **styles.css** - Added `.lower-third-center` positioning (centered, fade animation)
- ‚úÖ **graphics.js** - Added `showTripleL3s()` and `hideTripleL3s()` functions
- ‚úÖ **control.js** - Mode toggle handler, triple config builder, center preview support

#### **How It Works:**
```
DUAL MODE:
[LEFT L3]                                      [RIGHT L3]
 (with logo)                                   (with logo)

TRIPLE MODE:
[LEFT L3]              [CENTER L3]              [RIGHT L3]
 (with logo)           (NO LOGO)                (with logo)
```

**Center L3 Note:** As requested, the center position does NOT display a logo - this keeps the visual clean when showing 3 people simultaneously!

---

### 4. **URL Fix for GitHub Pages**
- ‚úÖ VMix URL field now correctly shows `output` instead of `control`
- ‚úÖ Works with and without `.html` extension
- ‚úÖ "Copy URL" and "Open Tab" buttons work correctly
- ‚úÖ Handles both local (`localhost:8080/output.html`) and GitHub Pages (`github.io/GFX/output`) URLs
