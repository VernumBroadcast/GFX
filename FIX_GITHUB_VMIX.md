# 🚨 QUICK FIX: GitHub Pages + VMix

## Your Problem:
✅ Graphics work in Chrome when you open `output.html`  
❌ Graphics DON'T show in VMix from `vernumbroadcast.github.io`

## Why:
You're loading a **blank URL** in VMix:
```
❌ https://vernumbroadcast.github.io/GFX/output.html
```

This shows nothing because **no graphic is specified!**

---

## ✅ THE FIX (2 minutes):

### Step 1: Generate a URL with Your Graphic

Open this file in your browser:
```
vmix-control.html
```

### Step 2: Fill in Your Graphic Details
- Primary Text: **Your Name Here**
- Secondary Text: **Your Title Here**  
- Colors: (adjust as needed)

### Step 3: Click "Generate URL"

You'll get something like:
```
https://vernumbroadcast.github.io/GFX/output.html?l3_show=true&l3_primary=Your%20Name%20Here&l3_secondary=Your%20Title%20Here&l3_primary_bg=%23ffffff&l3_secondary_bg=%23dc3545
```

### Step 4: Copy This URL into VMix

1. In VMix, edit your Browser input
2. **Replace the URL** with the generated one
3. Click **Reload**
4. ✨ **Your graphic will appear!**

## 🎯 Quick Test URL

Try this in VMix RIGHT NOW:
```
https://vernumbroadcast.github.io/GFX/output.html?l3_show=true&l3_primary=TEST&l3_secondary=It%20Works!&l3_primary_bg=%23ffffff&l3_secondary_bg=%23dc3545
```

If that shows "TEST / It Works!" in VMix → **SYSTEM IS WORKING!** 🎉

Then just generate your own URLs with different names/titles.

## 💡 Why This Works

**Without URL Parameters:**
- `output.html` loads → **shows nothing** (waiting for commands)
- Control panel in Chrome → sends commands → **VMix can't receive them** (different browser)
- Result: **blank screen** ❌

**With URL Parameters:**
- `output.html?l3_show=true&...` → **graphic baked into URL**
- Loads directly in VMix → **no control panel needed**
- Result: **graphic shows immediately** ✅

---

## 📋 Next Steps

1. Use `vmix-control.html` to generate URLs for each graphic you need
2. Save these URLs (Notepad, etc.)
3. Add each URL as a separate VMix input
4. Switch between them during your show

**Or:** See `GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md` for complete documentation
